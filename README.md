# SPECT8-OTT Documentation

This project contains the technical documentation _source_ files in folder `/tech-spec`. These files can be
compiled to the final documentation format using the `bin/generate_docs.sh` script.

The output is written to the `/docs` folder. Since the github repository is configured to use the "github pages"
feature, everything within the `/docs` folder is published to the web at https://vaudience.github.io/spect8-ott-docs
